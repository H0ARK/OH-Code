# Enhancing OpenHands: The Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework

## Vision

This project aims to extend OpenHands with a powerful hierarchical agent architecture, transforming it from a single-agent coding assistant into a coordinated multi-agent development system.

## Core Architecture

```
┌────────────────┐
│  Master Agent  │ ◄── User interaction, high-level planning
│ (Claude 3.5)   │
└───────┬────────┘
        │
        ▼
┌────────────────┐
│  Orchestrator  │ ◄── Git branch management, task distribution
│    Agent       │     Code review coordination
└───┬─────┬──────┘
    │     │
    ▼     ▼
┌─────┐ ┌─────┐
│Agent│ │Agent│ ◄── Specialized coding tasks in isolated branches
│  1  │ │  2  │     (Frontend, Backend, Testing, etc.)
└─────┘ └─────┘
```

## Key Enhancements

1. **Hierarchical Agent Coordination**
   - Master agent interprets user requirements and creates high-level plans
   - Orchestrator manages task distribution and integration
   - Specialized agents focus on specific components or technologies

2. **Git-Based Parallel Development**
   - Each agent works in isolated branches
   - Automatic code review between branches
   - Protected main codebase with controlled merges

3. **Enhanced Execution Model**
   - Leverages OpenHands' existing event stream architecture
   - Extends `user_response_fn` pattern for inter-agent communication
   - Uses shared workspace for collaborative development

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel task execution reduces overall completion time
   - Specialized agents can work efficiently in their domains
   - Reduced context window requirements for individual agents

## Implementation Path

- Extend the existing controller in `openhands/core/main.py`
- Create a master agent configuration optimized for planning
- Develop an orchestration layer to spawn and manage agent instances
- Implement a message routing system between agents
- Add code review and integration components

## Benefits Over Alternatives

Unlike creating an entirely new system, this approach:
- Leverages OpenHands' proven sandbox security model
- Maintains compatibility with existing tools and workflows
- Builds on extensively tested agent-runtime communication
- Preserves the robust execution model while adding coordination capabilities

This enhancement transforms OpenHands from a powerful individual coding assistant into a complete software development ecosystem capable of handling complex, multi-component projects with greater efficiency and coordination.
